# Information:

This is the main bot folder where everything is handled as well as extra logs and extensions.
As you can see we handle all of our custom plugin processors in the logs folder as well. This README file contains all
the information on how to get in touch with us to potentially add even more detailed support for your plugin, so please
read below.

## How to contact us:

If you want your plugin added you will obviously need to contact us in someway, so here are a few options and what information to give:

- Message Gabe_Real on discord : [Discord user](https://discord.com/users/1144561934025379881)
- Email Gabe_Real : [Email](gaberealj10@gmail.com)

All of which require you to provide the following information:

- What kind of support you would like. (eg. detection of wrong library versions)
- Links to websites your plugin information can be found.
- 2 or 3 different crashlogs with context of what went wrong and how to fix it.

###### We will get back to you shortly ðŸ’–
